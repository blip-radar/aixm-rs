# Semi-automatically generated AIXM parsing

Beware! This is a lot of auto generated code that does not adhere to the specification.

This can, with some luck parse Navaids, Waypoints, AirportHeliport, Runway and
Routes AIXM files. Most probably though it will still need additional types or
added nil/non-nil handling for a number of fields.
